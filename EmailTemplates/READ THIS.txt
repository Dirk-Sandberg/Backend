Inside the EmailTemplates folder we will have a folder for each SKU
inside each SKU folder we will have subfolders for templates for the following purposes:
	"You've successfully registered for a tournament" email
	"You've been assigned an opponent" email
All .html files in these folders should have the same name so code can get them easily.
----------------
We will also have a General folder which will contain non-product related emails
	"You've won some money, here's how to redeem" email
	"You failed to participate in the tournament, you don't get refunded" email
